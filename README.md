#### -> Formatting: Used conditional formatting, color themes, and custom designs for better readability.
#### -> Measures: Designed calculations to extract meaningful KPIs like average price/order and total revenue.
#### -> Data Modeling: Organized and cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
#### -> Pivot Tables: Used to summarize and analyze large volumes of data quickly.
#### -> DAX Functions: Created custom calculations to derive insights, such as revenue and transaction counts.
